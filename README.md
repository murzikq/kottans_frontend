Finished Task 0 (get familiar with Git and GitHub)

I didn't have much knowledge on how git/github works, so Udacity cours were very helpful. Information was structured and puted in simple form, quiz were quite helpful, sinse they showed my level of understanding. Git tutorial helped much with sorting and memorizing git commands wich i  learned from Udacity, i will probably return to it couple more times, until i will be able to use git properly.
